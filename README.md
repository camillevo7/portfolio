2015-1016

Though my main role is Demand and Pricing Analyst, I played a key role in business analytics, evaluating project life cycles for strategic decision-making. I successfully developed and maintained tracking spreadsheets in MS Excel, generated impactful reports aiding management decisions, and utilized SalesForce for data modeling and trend forecasting. I implemented efficient data collection processes, identified objectives through feedback analysis, and established standardized procedures for current and future processes. Notably, I instituted effective communication processes contributing to long-term organizational plans.
